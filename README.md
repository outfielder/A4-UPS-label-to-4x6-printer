# UPS A4 PDF label processor to 4x6 Thermal printer 

This program takes in the regular A4 PDF labels given by UPS and converts them so that they can be printed using a regular 4x6 inch thermal printer. This is only for Windows based operating systems, however, can be easily adapted for other operating systems, so contributions are highly welcome!

## Dependencies

This project requires you to download and install [IrfanView](https://www.irfanview.com/). Either of the 32-bit or the 64-bit version are fine to use.

## How to use

1. Install [IrfanView](https://www.irfanview.com/) and copy the full path of the Windows executable (i_view32.exe or i_view64.exe file) using the option in the Windows explorer ensuring you do not remove the quotation marks from the path.
2. Add the IrfanView path to the config.ini file.
3. Open any image in IrfanView and click on print.
4. Ensure your settings are the same as the settings shown and make sure to save them without printing.
5. Add any UPS A4 PDF labels to the same folder as the program.
6. Ensure that the default printer on your computer is the label printer you wish to have the labels printed to. Refer to [this](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/how-to-set-a-default-printer-in-windows-10-e10cf8b8-e596-b102-bf84-c41022b5036f) article if you are unsure on how to do so.
7. Run the executable/python script and it should automatically print and process your labels
